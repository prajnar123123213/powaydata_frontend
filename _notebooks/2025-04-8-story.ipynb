    "Using Machine Learning, API database/ endpoints, and interactive features, create a social media website that displays information about the City of Poway by increasing public awareness. This can be done by using infographics or minigames that go over traffic patterns, previous weather issues/disasters in Poway, and community resource distribution and city development. Create features that also interest engagement from users by providing interactive calenders and maps to bring the community closer together through pre-planned city events."

It helped me learn about upcoming community events, local parks, and even public safety updates. Thanks to it, I found a weekend farmers' market where I met some friendly neighbors. Now, Poway feels more like home.\n",
