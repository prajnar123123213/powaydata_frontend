    "1. **Community Insight**\n",
    "    - Since PilotCity expected us to increase community engagment by over 30%, we wanted to include a feautre that would allow differenet users to engage and communicate with each other. Our community Insight feature would allow users to leave reviews or talk about events that they attendted around Poway/ San Diego. Below is our inital Figma design for that specific page. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/figma2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tourist Attractions**\n",
    "    - This was added later to our website after the first live review, so we did not make an intial Figma desigm. However, we planned to make this in a table format that listed all the popular toursit attractions in San Diego/ Poway. Users could then filter out results based on what they're interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Calendar**\n",
    "    - This feature would allow for users to keep track of the events and informations that they come across on our webstie and note it down on the calendar. They can also add other events so they know when they are free or open to schedule something in. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"463\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/figma3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Live Activity/ Weather Tracker**\n",
    "    - This is a crucial part of our website since it would inclue API connection and also satisfies a large part of the Pilot City requirements. Pilot City said that they wanted the citizens of Poway to learn more about their own community, including data about the traffic, weather, and more. With our machine learning Weather Device we can give uers a place to come check weather predictions for future days before planning our trips around POway City. Another feature, our Live Activity, would also monitor popular tourist attractions around the country and report how busy it is at the current time, or when the location is the most busiest. \n",
